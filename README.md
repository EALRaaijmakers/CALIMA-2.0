ABOUT
CALIMA 2.0 is a C# and .NET-based software tool for analyzing calcium fluorescence imaging data. CALIMA 2.0 is able to identify individual cell activity in a network of cells and cross-referencing the activities of different cells. Modifications have been made in the source code of CALIMA 1.0 regarding the processing of the raw fluorescence traces, resulting in the extraction of the DeltaF/F0 traces which are a measure for the cells calcium concentrations. Furthermore, the algorithms have been simplified regarding the number of parameters to be set by the user, and suggestions are made regarding the parameter space. 

STARTING
Downloading and extracting the folder CALIMA 2.0 > CalciumImagingAnalyser > bin > Release should suffice to get CALIMA 2.0 up and running. CalciumImagingAnalyser.exe starts CALIMA 2.0. To start, you can load your own data or use the data in de folder Data_hiPSNCs_on_NG-PDMS_Bastiaens_2019. Hints about setting the parameters can be found in CALIMAv2.0_SettingParameters.docx.  

For developers, the entire CalciumImagingAnalyser folder is required to start working with CALIMA 2.0.
