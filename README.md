CALIMA 2.0 is a C# and .NET-based software tool for analyzing calcium fluorescence imaging data. CALIMA 2.0 is able to identify individual cell activity in a network of cells and cross-referencing the activities of different cells. Modifications have been made in the source code of CALIMA 1.0 regarding the processing of the raw fluorescence traces, resulting in the extraction of the DeltaF/F0 traces which are a measure for the cells calcium concentrations. Furthermore, the algorithms have been simplified regarding the number of parameters to be set by the user, and suggestions are made regarding the parameter space.
